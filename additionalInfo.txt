--> Each CSS file requires it's own HTTP request
--> Embedded CSS rules are render blocking

CHORES
- Add eslinting - does it make sense to do this for this project ?
- Add watching for changes (so you don't need to keep refreshing the browser window to view changes)

FEATURES
- Have both the scientific calculator versions in one
- Make calculator colors, font type (e.g. font used for numbers), corners (round or edge), whether to include both scientific and normal calculator sides or just one, styling (***not sure about this though) customizable
